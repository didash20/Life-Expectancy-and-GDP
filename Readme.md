# Life Expectancy and GDP

In this project, we analyze data on GDP and life expectancy from the World Health Organization and the World Bank to try and identify the relationship between the GDP and life expectancy of six countries.

During this project, we analyze, prepare, and plot data in order to answer questions in a meaningful way.

After performing the analysis, we'll be creating a blog post to share our findings on the World Health Organization website.
